INTRODUCTION                                        *accentuate*

Accentuate is a Vim plugin that uses the Accentuate.us web service to restore
accents and special characters to text in over a hundred languages. With it,
you can easily type plain text like this...

    Moi nguoi deu co quyen tu do ngon luan va bay to quan diem

...then automatically transform it into this:

    Mọi người đều có quyền tự do ngôn luận và bầy tỏ quan điểm

Accentuate works as an |operator|, like |yank|, |delete|, and other
built-in Vim operators, so it can be combined with any selection,
motion, or text object. That makes it easy to accentuate (for example)
the current line, a range of lines, or an entire file. (See the examples
in |accentuate-usage| below.)

You can learn more about the Accentuate.us service at http://accentuate.us/.


REQUIREMENTS                                        *accentuate-requirements*

* Vim 7.2 or later

    This plugin was developed and tested under Vim 7.2.

* Accentuate Command-line Client

    Accentuate requires that either the Perl or Python Accentuate client be
    installed. You can find both clients at http://accentuate.us/. (See
    |accentuate-installation| and |accentuate-options| for more information.)

* Access to the Accentuate.us Web Service

    The Accentuate plugin transforms text using the Accentuate.us web service.
    It will not function without an Internet connection and access to the
    Accentuate.us site.


INSTALLATION                                        *accentuate-installation*


USAGE                                               *accentuate-usage*

By default, Accentuate defines the following key mappings:

    {range}<Leader>''   : Accentuate {range} of lines
    <Leader>'{motion}   : Accentuate {motion} lines
    {Visual}<Leader>'   : Accentuate current Visual selection

Assuming <Leader> is set to the default (backslash) when the plugin is
loaded, these key mappings let you do things like the following:

    \''                 : Accentuate current line
    5\''                : Accentuate next five lines

    \'ip                : Accentuate current paragraph
    \'G                 : Accentuate rest of buffer
    gg\'G               : Accentuate entire buffer

    Vjj\'               : Visually highlight current line
                        : and next two lines, then accentuate
                        : highlighted lines.

Essentially, \' works like |y|, |d|, |>|, |=|, or any other |operator|, and
\'' behaves like |yy|, |dd|, |>>|, |==|, etc.

Of course, the user can define additional maps for common cases:

    nmap <F2>  \'ip
    nmap <F3>  gg\'G

The plugin key maps are customizable, so the user can also override the
defaults like so:

    nmap _  <Plug>AccentuateMotion
    nmap __ <Plug>AccentuateRange
    vmap _  <Plug>AccentuateVisual

Now the examples look this instead:

    __                  : Accentuate current line
    5__                 : Accentuate next five lines

    _ip                 : Accentuate current paragraph
    _G                  : Accentuate rest of buffer
    gg_G                : Accentuate entire buffer

    Vjj_                : Visually highlight current line
                        : and next two lines, then accentuate
                        : highlighted lines.


OPTIONS                                             *accentuate-options*

The Accentuate plugin exposes two settings:

    g:AccentuateUsCommand   : Client program, sans options (defaults
                            : to 'sf-client.pl')

    g:AccentuateUsLanguage  : Language code (defaults to 'ga')


Here's how a user might customize these settings in .vimrc:

    :let g:AccentuateUsCommand  = 'perl -CA ~/bin/sf-client.pl'
    :let g:AccentuateUsLanguage = 'chr'

(Note that g:AccentuateUsCommand can actually be a partial command line,
and that the client program doesn't have to be in the user's path.)

These can be changed at any time, and the key maps will immediately use
the new settings. They can even be combined with custom key maps, so
different keystrokes can use different languages (or even different
programs):

    " Correct whole file using Gaelic.
    :nmap <F5>   :let g:AccentuateUsLanguage='ga'<CR>gg\'G

    " Correct whole file using Hawaiian.
    :nmap <F6>   :let g:AccentuateUsLanguage='haw'<CR>gg\'G

    " Correct whole file using Cherokee:
    :nmap <F7>   :let g:AccentuateUsLanguage='chr'<CR>gg\'G

One interesting side effect of maps like this is that, since the
settings are global, subsequent commands continue using the new
settings. I choose to view this as a feature. :-)


LIMITATIONS                                         *accentuate-limitations*

Since the Accentuate plugin calls the client program as a filter, it only
operates on whole lines, even if only part of a line is selected. No matter
how much or how little of a line in a range is selected, Vim still provides
the entire line to the filter command (and replaces that entire line once the
filter has finished). This limitation may be removed in a future version of
the plugin.
